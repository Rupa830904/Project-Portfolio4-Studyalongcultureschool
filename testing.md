## Accessibility

[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed

## Validator Testing

All pages were run through the [w3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Initially there were some errors due to stray script tags, misuse of headings within spans and some unclosed elements. All of these issues were corrected and all pages passed validation.

To test the validation on the files, open the page to validate, right click and view page source. Paste the raw html code into the validator as this will be only the HTML rendered code.More evidences added for each page validation under docs/testing_images folder.

![HTML Validator7](static/docs/testing_images/Html_validator_post_faq.JPG)
![HTML Validator8](static/docs/testing_images/Html_validator_ans_faq.JPG)

All pages were run through the pycodestyle validator , to ensure all code was pep8 compliant. Some errors were shown due to blank spacing and lines too long, 1 line instead of 2 expected. All of these errors were resolved and code passed through pycodestyle check with the exception of the settings.py file.
